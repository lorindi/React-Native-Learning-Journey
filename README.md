# React Native Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning journey through the "React Native - The Practical Guide" course.

## How to Use This Repository

As I progress through the course, I will:
1. **Track my progress** in the `course-progress.md` file by checking off completed lectures
2. **Take notes** in the section-specific README files (e.g., `section-1-getting-started/README.md`)
3. **Document code examples** in each section's directory
4. **Build projects** in dedicated folders (e.g., `section-2-basics-goals-app/GoalsApp/`)
5. **Record daily learning** in the `learning-journal.md` file
6. **Collect useful resources** in the `resources/` directory

## What to Write in Each File

### Section README Files (e.g., section-1-getting-started/README.md)
- **Lectures in this Section**: Already pre-filled with lecture titles
- **Key Concepts Learned**: Core principles, frameworks, or paradigms introduced in the section
  - Example: "React Native uses a 'bridge' to communicate between JavaScript and native code"
  - Example: "Components in React Native are similar to React for web but use native components"
- **Setup and Installation**: Commands, tools, and configuration steps
- **Core Fundamentals**: Basic building blocks and patterns specific to the section
- **Notes**: Additional insights, explanations, or clarifications
- **Code Examples**: Snippets showing syntax or patterns
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Problems encountered and how you solved them

### Project README Files (e.g., section-2-basics-goals-app/GoalsApp/README.md)
- **Project Overview**: Brief description of the project's purpose
- **Features**: List of functionalities implemented
- **Implementation Details**: Technical approach and architecture
- **What I Learned**: New skills or knowledge gained
- **Screenshots**: Visual documentation of your project
- **How to Run**: Instructions to execute the project
- **Notes and Observations**: Personal reflections or additional context

### Daily Learning Journal (learning-journal.md)
