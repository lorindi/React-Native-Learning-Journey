# React Native Learning Journal

## Day 1 - May 8, 2025

### Today I learned
- The fundamental difference between React Native and other cross-platform technologies
- How to set up a development environment for React Native using Expo
- The structure of a basic React Native project
- How React Native bridges JavaScript code with native platform capabilities
- The core components View and Text and how they differ from HTML elements

### Code examples
```javascript
// Basic React Native component
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

function GreetingComponent() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.greeting}>Hello, React Native!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 16,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    borderRadius: 8,
  },
  greeting: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#333',
  },
});

export default GreetingComponent;
```

### Challenges
- Had trouble getting Expo working on my physical device at first
- Initially confused about how styling works in React Native
- Understanding the project folder structure was a bit overwhelming

### Solutions
- Reinstalled Expo Go app and made sure my phone and computer were on the same WiFi network
- Learned that StyleSheet.create is similar to CSS but with JavaScript objects and camelCase
- Drew a diagram of the project structure to better understand how files relate to each other

### Tomorrow's plan
- Complete Section 1 lectures
- Start building the first simple app
- Practice more with basic components and styling
- Try creating a custom component from scratch
